        <h1>History:</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Football, known as soccer in some countries, has a rich history dating back to ancient civilizations. The modern version originated in England during the 19th century, with the establishment of standardized rules. The first Football Association was founded in 1863, leading to the sport's widespread popularity. Early competitions like the FA Cup began in 1871. Internationally, football expanded with the formation of FIFA in 1904, and the inaugural World Cup in 1930. Football's global appeal is unmatched, captivating millions with its dynamic play and deep-rooted traditions.</p>

        <h1>Rules:</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Football, governed by the Laws of the Game, has 17 essential rules. Each match is played by two teams of eleven players, including a goalkeeper. Matches last 90 minutes, split into two 45-minute halves. The objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the opponent's net. Players cannot use their hands or arms, except for goalkeepers within their penalty area. Offside rules prevent goal-hanging, while fouls and misconduct lead to free kicks or penalties. Substitutions allow for tactical changes. The referee ensures fair play and adherence to the rules.</p>
        
        <h1>Future:</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">The future of football looks promising, with technological advancements and global growth shaping the sport. VAR (Video Assistant Referee) and goal-line technology enhance fairness and accuracy in officiating. Sustainability efforts are becoming integral, with clubs and organizations prioritizing environmental initiatives. Women's football is experiencing unprecedented growth, gaining more visibility and support worldwide. The rise of esports and virtual football competitions are attracting new audiences. Innovations in training and sports science are elevating player performance and reducing injuries. Football's universal appeal ensures its continued evolution and dominance in the world of sports.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            Indian football, with a history spanning over a century, has evolved from a humble beginning to a promising future. The sport's early days saw the formation of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) in 1937, and India's participation in international competitions began with the 1948 Olympics. Despite initial successes, including the gold medal in the 1951 Asian Games and the 1962 Asian Games, football struggled to gain prominence compared to cricket. 
            <br>
            In recent years, Indian football has experienced significant growth. The introduction of the Indian Super League (ISL) in 2014 revolutionized the sport with increased investment, professionalization, and enhanced visibility. The ISL attracted international stars and fostered a new generation of talent, helping to raise the profile of Indian football both domestically and globally. 
            <br>
            Grassroots initiatives and youth academies are now key focuses, aiming to develop young players and improve the national team’s performance. The Indian national team, known as the Blue Tigers, continues to strive for success in international tournaments. With ongoing improvements in infrastructure, coaching, and player development, Indian football is poised for a brighter future, with aspirations of qualifying for the World Cup and excelling on the global stage.
